This is a collection of html/css/js (and in the future any other languages) used to get FreeCodeCamp certifications. If you would like to see what these webpages look like you can visit my codepen.io account here : https://codepen.io/mic-cohagan . PLEASE feel free to reference these documents if you're working on this certification but DO NOT copy any of my work. FreeCodeCamp will revoke your certification and make your account publicly known as a plagairizing account.
